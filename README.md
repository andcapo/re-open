# Re-Open Safely Kit
This is a simple printable kit to provide information to the public visiting shops, offices and locations on how to maintain social distancing.

## Principles
We use a mix of text, emoji and colours to make this kit understandable by everyone. This project is being translated in many languages so when people travel will know what to do keeping everyone safe.

## Languages
This project is currently available in the following languages: 

* ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English - UK
